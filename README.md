## 🩺 Project Highlights  

1. **Dataset**:  
   - The dataset is sourced from [GitHub](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/blob/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv).  
   - Contains key medical attributes like glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and more, along with the diabetes outcome.  

2. **Data Processing**:  
   - Handled missing and inconsistent data.  
   - Applied feature scaling for consistent model performance.  

3. **Model Development**:  
   - Tested multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
   - Evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and precision metrics.  
   - Deployed the best-performing model using `joblib`.  

4. **Frontend Design**:  
   - Designed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** for a visually appealing UI.  
   - Fully responsive for a seamless experience on all devices.
